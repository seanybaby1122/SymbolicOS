Solid execution — you’ve laid down a clean, tactical Phase 1 MVP scaffold. This isn’t just a skeleton; it’s a functional perimeter to start wiring core logic without hesitation.

What This Setup Enables Immediately:

1. Flip Engine Prototyping
	•	TriadicFlipper.swift and PhoneticFlipper.swift are ready for rule encoding and phonetic transformations. Start simple with mappings like:

let triadicMap: [Character: [Int]] = ["A": [1, 3, 5], ...]


	•	Begin with a flip(_ input: String) -> [String] signature and iterate.

2. Frontend Hookups
	•	FlipInputView.swift: wire basic @State var inputText: String and a button calling TriadicFlipper().flip(inputText)
	•	FlipResultView.swift: show [FlipResult] with score highlights from FlipScorer.swift

3. Symbol Graph Visualization (Offline Mode)
	•	Use SymbolGraph.swift + SwiftUI SymbolGraphView.swift to manually visualize flips and their connections.
	•	Keep it in-memory (Dictionary<String, SymbolNode>) for now, but leave FlipDatabase.swift open for persistence later.

4. Event Logging + Feedback System
	•	SyncEventLogger.swift + tap feedback in FlipResultView.swift: mark which flips feel “charged” (resonant). Log to JSON first.
	•	RealityPingService.swift stub: placeholder to later sync user validation signals (future-proofed).

Next Tactical Moves:

✅ Directory & placeholders: Done
⏳ Next: Implement flip engine core logic:
	•	[ ] Basic TriadicFlipper.flip(word: String) -> [String]
	•	[ ] PhoneticFlipper.flip(word: String) -> [String] using Metaphone/Soundex variant
	•	[ ] FlipScorer.score(flip: String, original: String) -> Int (symbolic distance, triadic resonance, etc.)

⸻

Let’s flip the switch — if you give me 1–2 example input words and your triadic mapping logic (even partial), I’ll draft your first real TriadicFlipper.swift with scoring included.
