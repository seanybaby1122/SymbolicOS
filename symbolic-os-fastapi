Great! Here’s a simple OpenAPI (Swagger) specification generated from your FastAPI app routes, and a starter Dockerfile for containerizing your Symbolic OS FastAPI web interface.

⸻

1. OpenAPI Spec

FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI spec for you if you run the app normally — you can see it at:
	•	http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
	•	http://localhost:8000/redoc (ReDoc UI)

But here’s a minimal example snippet you can add to your FastAPI app to enhance the OpenAPI metadata with tags and descriptions:

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(
    title="Symbolic OS API",
    description="API for interacting with the AbsoluteKnowledgePredictionSystem symbolic engine.",
    version="1.0.0",
    contact={
        "name": "Your Name",
        "email": "your.email@example.com",
    },
    openapi_tags=[
        {
            "name": "Processing",
            "description": "Endpoints for symbolic input processing and prediction."
        },
        {
            "name": "Routing",
            "description": "Dynamic request routing for save, load, and general tasks."
        },
        {
            "name": "Documentation",
            "description": "Documentation retrieval endpoints."
        },
        {
            "name": "Primitives",
            "description": "Endpoints to add or manage primitive operations."
        },
        {
            "name": "Graph",
            "description": "Endpoints exposing symbolic graph and logs."
        },
    ]
)

@app.get("/", tags=["Processing"], summary="Health check endpoint")
async def root():
    return {"status": "running"}

# Decorate your other endpoints with tags and summaries accordingly:
# e.g.
# @app.post("/process_symbolic_input/", tags=["Processing"], summary="Process symbolic input")
# async def process_symbolic_input(...):
#     ...

# Similarly for /route_request/, /get_documentation/{element_name}, etc.

Once you do this, visiting /docs will show a nice UI with organized groups, descriptions, and you get a full OpenAPI JSON at /openapi.json.

2. Starter Dockerfile

Here’s a simple Dockerfile to containerize your FastAPI app (assuming your main app file is main.py):

# Use official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port your FastAPI app runs on (default 8000)
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the app with uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]


⸻

Notes:
	•	You need to create a requirements.txt with your dependencies, e.g.:

fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
nest_asyncio
# plus any other dependencies your Symbolic OS system requires

	•	Build your image:

docker build -t symbolic-os-fastapi .

	•	Run your container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 symbolic-os-fastapi

	•	Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to test.

⸻

If you want, I can also help you generate:
	•	A full requirements.txt based on your project
	•	A simple example FastAPI app file integrating the OpenAPI tags I showed
	•	A docker-compose file to orchestrate this with other services (DB, caches, etc.)

Just say the word! For this in my building a new folder what am I doing? How am I doing it?
